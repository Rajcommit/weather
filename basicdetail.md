This Bash script is used to **initialize and validate data files** for a weather **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow. It ensures that key TSV files exist, have the correct headers, and contain proper comments where needed.

Let’s walk through it **step by step**, so you fully understand what each part does.

---

## 🔰 HEADER

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Initialize project data files used by the weather ETL workflow.
set -euo pipefail
```

* `#!/usr/bin/env bash`: Runs the script using Bash (environment path is used for portability).
* `set -euo pipefail`: Safe scripting practices:

  * `-e`: Exit on error
  * `-u`: Exit if using undefined variables
  * `-o pipefail`: Catch errors in piped commands

---

## 📄 Input Variables (With Defaults)

```bash
LOG_FILE=${1:-rx_poc.log}
ACCURACY_FILE=${2:-historical_fc_accuracy.tsv}
INPUT_TEMPLATE=${3:-rx_poc_manual_input.tsv}
```

* These allow you to pass custom filenames as arguments:

  * `$1` → log file (default: `rx_poc.log`)
  * `$2` → accuracy file (default: `historical_fc_accuracy.tsv`)
  * `$3` → input template (default: `rx_poc_manual_input.tsv`)

---

## 🧠 Function: `ensure_header`

```bash
ensure_header() {
  local file=$1
  local header=$2
  ...
}
```

---
```This function ensures a file exists, is not empty, and has the correct header line.

In printf '%s\n' "$header" >"$file" the '%s\n' part is called the format string.

%s means: "print the argument as a string."
\n means: "add a new line (line break) after printing."

So, '%s\n' tells printf to:

Print one string (replace %s with the value of $header)
Go to the next line (add a newline character so the file doesn't run all words together)

Example:
If $header is "Name\tAge",
the command will create a file with

text
Name    Age
on the first line, and then move to the next line, ready for more data. ```



### ✅ What it does:

1. **If the file doesn’t exist or is empty**:

   * It creates it and writes the `header`.
2. **If the header is incorrect**:

   * It rewrites the file with the correct header and appends the rest of the file (minus the wrong header).
   * It uses a temporary file to ensure safe overwriting (`"${file}.tmp"` → `mv` back to the original).

## 📝 Function: `ensure_log`

```bash
ensure_log() {
  ensure_header "$LOG_FILE" $'year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp'
}
```

* Ensures the log file has this exact header:

  ```
  year	month	day	obs_temp	fc_temp
  ```

---

## 📊 Function: `ensure_accuracy`

```bash
ensure_accuracy() {
  ensure_header "$ACCURACY_FILE" $'year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp\taccuracy\taccuracy_range'
}
```

* Ensures the accuracy file has this header:

  ```
  year	month	day	obs_temp	fc_temp	accuracy	accuracy_range
  ```

---

## 📥 Function: `ensure_template`

```bash
ensure_template() {
  ensure_header "$INPUT_TEMPLATE" $'year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp'
  if ! grep -q '^#' "$INPUT_TEMPLATE"; then
    {
      printf '%s\n' $'# Add additional rows below using tab-separated values, e.g.:'
      printf '%s\n' $'# 2024\t05\t01\t23.5\t24.0'
    } >>"$INPUT_TEMPLATE"
  fi
}
```

### Detailed breakdown

1. **Header guard:** `ensure_header "$INPUT_TEMPLATE" ...` recreates the template if it is missing, empty, or has the wrong header, keeping it aligned with the main log schema (`year`, `month`, `day`, `obs_temp`, `fc_temp`).
2. **Detect existing guidance:** `if ! grep -q '^#' "$INPUT_TEMPLATE"; then` flips the `grep` result so the helper text is only appended when no comment lines are present yet. That ensures repeated runs do not generate duplicate instructions.
3. **Append atomically:** The grouped block `{ ... } >>"$INPUT_TEMPLATE"` collects both `printf` calls under a single append redirection. If the script aborted midway, you would never end up with half of the guidance text.
4. **Human-friendly example:** ANSI-C quoting (`$''`) expands `\t` into real tab characters, so the example line displays the expected delimiter sequence (`2024\t05\t01\t23.5\t24.0`). Users can copy the line as-is and still satisfy downstream parsers.

## 🏁 Final Calls – Actually Executes the Functions

```bash
ensure_log
ensure_accuracy
ensure_template
```

* Runs all three functions in order to prepare the data files.

## 💡 Summary: What the Script Does

When run, this script:

1. **Creates or corrects** the log file (`LOG_FILE`) to have a consistent format.
2. **Creates or corrects** the forecast accuracy file (`ACCURACY_FILE`) to ensure ETL can read it.
3. **Creates or corrects** the input template file (`INPUT_TEMPLATE`) to be user-friendly and ready for manual input.
4. Ensures data consistency and avoids manual setup errors — perfect for scripting ETL jobs.

### 🔄 Example: Run It

```bash
./init_data.sh custom_log.tsv custom_accuracy.tsv custom_input.tsv
```

Or, just run:

```bash
./init_data.sh
```

...to use default filenames.
